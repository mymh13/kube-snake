### Current checklist:
  
1. Replace AddDistributedMemoryCache with Redis distributed cache
2. After that we can fix the erranous log out/log in problem behaviour
3. Then we need to fix the time and date and show the username (not the role) of the person who posts in the guestbook
4. At this point we add the admin tool to delete posts
