            This page is served from a K3s cluster running on a cloud VM.
            The pod contains an nginx:alpine container serving static HTML.
            Deployment is automated via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that builds a Docker image,
            pushes to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), and deploys to the cluster using kubectl.
            Traffic is routed through Caddy reverse proxy with automatic SSL termination.
        </p>
        <p>Work in progress - microservices architecture under development.</p>
